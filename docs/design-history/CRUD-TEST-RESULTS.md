## Test Details

### Test 1: Create Project
- **POST** `/api/projects` with `{"title":"QA CRUD Test Project","description":"Automated CRUD verification","tags":["qa","test","crud"]}`
- Response: `ok: true`, project with 4 auto-generated columns
- Columns verified: Backlog (#6c757d), In Progress (#ffc107), Review (#fd7e14), Done (#198754)
- Tags preserved: `["qa","test","crud"]`

### Test 2: Create Tasks
- **POST** `/api/projects/{id}/tasks` × 2
- Task Alpha: priority=high, checklist=[Step A1, Step A2]
- Task Beta: priority=medium, checklist=[Step B1]
- GET project confirms taskCount=2

### Test 3: Update Task
- **PUT** `/api/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}` with `{"title":"Task Alpha UPDATED","priority":"critical"}`
- Read-back via GET confirms title and priority changed

### Test 4: Move Task
- **PUT** `/api/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}` with `{"columnId":"<In Progress column ID>"}`
- Read-back confirms columnId matches In Progress

### Test 5: Delete Project
- **DELETE** `/api/projects/{id}` returns `ok: true`
- GET `/api/projects` confirms project ID no longer present
